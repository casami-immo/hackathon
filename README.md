# Short Description
We propose a real estate virtual visit app with an AI real estate agent.

# Long Description
In France, every year real estate visits cost est. 20 millions hours to sellers / renters and visitors. 
It takes 8-10 visits for each transaction. Meanwhile, the current virtual visit solutions are image only, noninteractive and expensive (hundreds of â‚¬).  

We propose a video-based virtual visit with an AI real estate agent to present the property and answer questions, providing a natural, interactive, and affordable solution. 
We aim to reduce physical visit by 70%, at the cost of 1/5th of the current virtual visit solutions.
